# FT-891-Audio_Interface
Yaesu FT-891 to headset audio interface

A small project to allow easy interface of a Yaesu FT-891 to a cellphone headset or an Aviation headset.

[Derived from the work described here](https://docsbydesign.com/2015/10/31/aircraft-headset-to-ham-radio-adapter/) by Bob Watson.

Possible additional filtering on the input and output paths inspired by [W2AEW's D-104 microphone preamp](https://www.qsl.net/w2aew/myd104amp.html) and possible additional work based on [KR6ZY's station audio interface](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/station-console).
